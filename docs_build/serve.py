"""Live documentation preview for Yohou-Optuna.

Run the documentation server together with a file watcher that regenerates the
API pages whenever the package source changes, so a newly added class appears in
the preview without a restart.

This replaces what the mkdocs ``on_pre_build`` hook did during ``serve``, in a
form that does not depend on the documentation engine executing a hook. That
independence is the point: the successor engine runs no hooks, and it refuses to
watch files outside the project folder -- so it cannot watch ``src/`` at all. An
external watcher is the only mechanism that works under either engine.

The division of labour: this watcher owns ``src/`` (source change -> regenerate
the API pages under ``docs/pages/api/``), and the documentation engine watches
only ``docs/`` (a regenerated page -> rebuild the site and reload the browser).
That is why ``mkdocs.yml`` watches ``docs`` and not ``src``.

Run it with ``just serve`` or ``nox -s serve_docs``; both call this module.
Notebooks are deliberately out of scope for the live watcher (their export
executes the notebook, which is slow); they are exported once at startup and are
otherwise a build-time step, matching ``serve-fast``/``MKDOCS_SKIP_NOTEBOOKS``.
