"""Marker resolution and the API sidebar TOC, as engine-independent hosts.

This is what ``hooks.on_page_markdown`` and the ``module_toc`` half of
``hooks.on_page_content`` used to do, plus every builder they relied on, now
hosted in a Python-Markdown extension instead of mkdocs hooks. mkdocs and the
successor engine (Zensical) both drive the same Python-Markdown, so this keeps
working when the ``hooks:`` key does not.

Two facts make it possible, both settled by spike (see the change's design):

1. **Loading.** A markdown extension is loaded by *module name* at config time,
   before any hook runs, so ``docs_build/`` must be importable then.
   ``dev-mode-dirs = ["."]`` in the wheel target puts the repo root on
   ``sys.path`` in the editable install, so ``docs_build._markers`` resolves --
   with nothing added to the built wheel.
2. **Page context.** A Preprocessor is handed the ``Markdown`` instance, not the
   page. ``_current_page(md)`` recovers it the same way mkdocstrings does: the
   Zensical page provider if present, else the ``mkdocs-autorefs`` plugin's
   ``current_page``. Writing ``page.meta`` from the Preprocessor reaches the
   template intact -- the mechanism the ``module_toc`` sidebar depends on.

The ``<!-- SUBPAGES -->`` index is built off the filesystem: a markdown extension
never receives mkdocs' ``files`` collection, so it scans the index page's own
directory instead.
