static -- the package is never imported -- so this runs in an environment where
the package's own dependencies are absent.

Importable and runnable on its own::

This module deliberately imports nothing from ``mkdocs``. It is called from
``docs_build/build.py``'s ``prebuild`` step (and by ``serve.py`` on a source
edit), but nothing here depends on that being the caller -- which is what makes
it testable without a docs build, and what the template's test suite enforces.

``docs_build/_markers.py`` also imports the discovery helpers below (the marker
builders need the same answer to "what is public in this package?"), so this
module is the one definition of that surface. Two definitions drift, and the
drift renders as a missing page rather than an error.

    1. **Declarations always count.**
    2. **An import counts when ``__all__`` names it**, wherever it points. That
       is what makes a re-export a deliberate part of the API rather than a
       detail, and it is the only way a dependency's symbol becomes ours.
    3. **A package's ``__init__`` re-exports by convention**, so an in-package
       import counts there even with no ``__all__``. A PLAIN module does not:
       ``from .base import Helper`` in ``translator.py`` is normally something
       that module uses, not something it advertises.

    Rule 3 is the one with teeth in both directions. Drop its first half and a
    package that re-exports without ``__all__`` loses every page it publishes.
    Drop its second half -- treat every module's imports as public -- and the
    seven packages generated from this template gain **67 phantom pages**, each
    a second URL for a symbol already documented elsewhere. The distinction is
    inherited verbatim from the AST implementation this replaced; it was right.

    4. **``__all__`` beats a submodule of the same name.** A package holding
       ``commands.py`` that also does ``from .commands import commands`` has the
       submodule occupying ``members["commands"]``; Python's import rebinds the
       name to the function, and ``module.imports`` records that binding
       independently. Without this the function's page disappears.

    ``exports`` is ``None`` when there is no ``__all__`` and an EMPTY LIST when
    ``__all__`` is computed (a comprehension) -- hence ``if exports`` and not
    ``if exports is not None``. The latter filters an empty list down to zero
