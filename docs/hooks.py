    The glossary page is the single source of truth: terms are read from it, so
    a term and its definition cannot drift apart the way a second list in this
    file would.

    A term opts in with ``.autolink``::

        Memory buffer { #memory-buffer .autolink }
        :   The internal store of recent rows...

    Opting in is deliberate rather than automatic. A glossary defines whatever
    its authors find worth defining, including short common words -- "step",
    "pipeline", "ensemble" -- and auto-linking those wherever they appear in
    prose produces noise, not navigation. Defining a term and advertising it
    everywhere are separate editorial decisions, so they get separate syntax.
