static -- the package is never imported -- so this runs in an environment where
the package's own dependencies are absent.

Importable and runnable on its own::

    python docs/_api_pages.py

This module deliberately imports nothing from ``mkdocs``. It is called from
``docs/hooks.py``'s ``on_pre_build`` so that ``mkdocs serve`` regenerates on a
source edit, but nothing here depends on that being the caller -- which is what
makes it testable without a docs build, and what the template's test suite
enforces.

``docs/hooks.py`` also imports the discovery helpers below (the page hooks need
the same answer to "what is public in this package?"), so this module is the one
definition of that surface. Two definitions drift, and the drift renders as a
missing page rather than an error.
