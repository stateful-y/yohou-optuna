"""Export the Yohou-Optuna example notebooks to static HTML.

Runs every marimo notebook under ``examples/`` and writes a rendered page per
notebook into ``docs/examples/<stem>/``. Exporting executes the notebook, which
dominates a docs build, so each export is cached against a hash of the
notebook's source.

Importable and runnable on its own::

    python docs/_notebooks.py

This module exists only when the project was generated with examples enabled --
the template does not emit it otherwise, so nothing here needs to guard on that.

It deliberately imports nothing from ``mkdocs``. The one place it needs mkdocs'
attention is the stem-collision warning, which reaches it by logging under the
``mkdocs`` logger tree by name; mkdocs counts those warnings and a ``--strict``
build fails on them, without this module importing anything.
